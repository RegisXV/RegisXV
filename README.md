- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RegisXV
I am currently getting my masters in computer science software engineering
A lot of my original background is in game design with engines such as Unity and Unreal engine 4
As of right now I am currently trying to expand my horizons with web development python-flask applications/html,css and
sneaking in a little bit of javascript game development frameworks such as
Phaser 3 and Kaboom  
Interested in learning new languages to expand my knowledge on the field and using my current skill set to make something I can be proud of.
Always looking for game design collaborations and am open to website development.
